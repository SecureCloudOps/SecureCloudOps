## About
I am a hands-on **Cloud and DevSecOps Engineer** specializing in designing, securing, and automating production-grade cloud platforms on AWS. My work focuses on building systems that are secure by default, highly reliable, and operationally efficient.

I bring a strong infrastructure and security mindset to every project, combining **Infrastructure as Code, Kubernetes, CI/CD automation, and cloud security controls** to reduce risk, improve delivery speed, and support compliance requirements.

I am particularly focused on:
- Secure and compliant cloud architectures  
- Automation-first infrastructure and deployments  
- Reliability, observability, and operational excellence  
- Cost awareness and least-privilege access models
